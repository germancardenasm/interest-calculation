### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect
information, and describe the issue in detail _in your report_. Following the
bug issue template should prompt you for any information we may need, but feel
free to include any information you feel is relevant to the bug.
